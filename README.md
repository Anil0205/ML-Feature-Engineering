# Feature Engineering

In This Repo I am completely posting the Data Preprocessing on structure Data. Since Data Preprocessing was one of the most challenging task for many of the ML Engineers I came-up with this repo to share all the important techniques which are usefull to clean the data.




## Steps to follow for developing Ml Models



    - Data collecting 
    - Selecting Required Packages 
    - Handling NUll values for Numerical and Categorical data 
    - converting Categorical_data features to Numerical features
    - Varibale Transformation 
    - Handling Outliers 
    - Selecting the Best Features for the Model
               - This techniques come under Feature Selection                          
    - Developing few Model
    - Selecting Best model to get better performances on test data  
    - Saving the Model 
    - Using Flask or Djano creating an UI to post inputs from the customers 
    - Hosting the Project in some cloud serives like
             - AWS
             - Azure 
             - Google cloud
             - Salesforce Heroku etc..
## Feature selection for structure data


After completing feature-engineering we are now ready to select the best fearures for our model there are some techniques which helps us to select the best features.

- Filter Method
- Wapper Method
- Embedded Method
- Statistical Method
- Correlation
